// now let's dive deep into implementation details

// in C++ there is a thing called 'concepts'
// they describe requirements for types, that need to be satisfied
// starting from memory size of type, ending at minute details about its methods

// if type 'T' satisfies all requirements of a concept 'C', then we say that T models C
// for example float and double model std::floating_point and lambdas model std::invocable

// concepts refine older C++ concept: Named Requirements
// those are abstract rules that types must follow if thew want to perform specific operaions
// concepts were added in C++20, meaning that for 22 years C++ standard library was written without them
// huge amount of std code does not depend on them, being the reason why C++ errors are so bizzare-looking
// (not to mention that for ~12 years C++ was not standardized)

// the most important concept used in this ECS is std::movable
// it requires types to:
// be move-constructible (have move-constructor)
// be move-assignable (have move-assign operator)
// be swappable (have method swap() or have specialized std::swap)

// now that you know what concepts are and understand what std::movable types are capable of
// I can now explain what in-place components are

// in-place components are components which are not moved in the internal storage on basic operations like add/remove
// this means that any pointers or references to them will not be invalidated while performing
// operationson the other components of that type, in contrast to regular components
// this also means that storage for in-place components might not be random-access
// marking components are in-place components works simmilar to flag components
// you need to make compile-time constant named inPlaceComponent/InPlaceComponent/in_place_component = true

struct Ship {
	static constexpr bool inPlaceComponent = true;

	float health;
	float bulletDamage;
};

// by default components are not in-place components
// you can still explicitly mark them as not in-place
// however if you do that, while components does not model std::movable
// you will get a compilation error, because non-movable components can only be in-place
// and non-movables will be marked as in-place by default

// I have mentioned 'internal storage' before, but what does it mean?
// every instance of 'Ship', requires 8 bytes of memory
// this memory is handled internally by ComponentPools
// by default, this memory for components is segmented into pages of size 1024 (instances, not bytes)
// thanks to this, add operation on components will not reallocate nor move any components in memory
// It may only allocate new page if previous pages are full
// just as all the other settings, this also can be customized in class by compile-time constant
// componentPageSize/ComponentPageSize/component_page_size = <page-size>
// pageSize is ignored if component is marked as flag-component
// ATTENTION! page size must be a power of two, to aquire (2^N) just write (1 << N)

// those 3 settings can be written in definition of your class
// but it can also be put into specialization of arch::ecs::ComponentSpecs<T>, which will override all other settings
// contrary to in-class settings, this method requires you to explicitly set all settings, not just one

template<>
struct arch::ecs::ComponentSpecs<Ship> {
	// prolonging in-class setting
	// if set to false, in-class setting would be overridden
	static constexpr bool inPlace = true;

	// not empty -> not a flag
	static constexpr bool flag = false;

	// let's change pageSize to something different
	// for example: 2^5 = 32
	static constexpr size_t pageSize = (1 << 5);
};

// let's now check if our settings acually work

TEST(ECS, ComponentInPlaceCustomPageSize) {
	ecs::Domain domain;

	std::array<ecs::Entity, 32 * 3> entities;

		auto& ship3 = domain.getComponent<Ship>(entities[i + 64]);

		// but since they are on different pages, they are not
		// (there still is non-zero chance of them being that close, because of that tests below are commented out)

		// ASSERT_NE(&ship1 + 64, &ship3);
		// ASSERT_NE(&ship2 + 32, &ship3);

		// let's remove them from 1-30

	// (by close means one instance after another)
	ASSERT_NE(abs(&domain.getComponent<Ship>(entities[31]) - &domain.getComponent<Ship>(entities[0])), sizeof(Ship));

	// also their place in memory has not changed
	ASSERT_EQ(&shipOf0, &domain.getComponent<Ship>(entities[0]));
	ASSERT_EQ(&shipOf31, &domain.getComponent<Ship>(entities[31]));
}

// this is mostly it for components
// remember that these are just examples
// not every components needs to be full-public struct
// ECS supports classes with private fields/methods
// but doesn't suppot polymorphic classes
// because being polymorphic makes memory of an object
// very complex with virtual tables, and very 'implementation-defined'
